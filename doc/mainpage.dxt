 \section intro Welcome to the Adonthell Programmer's documentation

 These pages contain the Adonthell API documentation, to aid new programmers and script
 writers. It is accompanied by the 
 <a href="http://adonthell.berlios.de/doc/index.php/Architecture:Contents">Adonthell Engine 
 Architecture</a> documentation, which gives an overview over basic design principles 
 and all the <a href="namespaces.html">modules</a> that form the engine.
 
 The <a href="http://adonthell.berlios.de/doc/index.php/Scripting:Contents">Adonthell 
 Scripting Guide</a> is focused on writing the various Python scripts required to turn
 the engine into a true role playing game. Read this to learn more about the scripts'
 layout; then use the API to write the code.
