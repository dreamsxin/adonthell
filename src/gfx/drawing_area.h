     * Implements "drawing zones" for drawing operations.
     * An object which is drawn into a drawing_area will only appear in
     * the rectangular zone it covers.
     * During some drawing operations, you may want to limit the blits to a limited
     * area of the %screen. For example, if you want to draw an image into a
     * window, and that image is larger than this window, you don't want the
     * entire image to appear, only the part that fits into the window. This is
     * exactly what drawing areas are for. A drawing area is a square that can be
     * any size and located anywhere on the %screen. If you assign a drawing area
     * to a drawable object (for example, an image), and then draw the image on
     * the %screen, the part of the image that doesn't fit the drawing area limits
     * isn't displayed. A drawing area can be assigned to any drawable, but also
     * to another drawing area, in which case the result of blitting operations
     * from objects that are assigned to the second drawing area will be limited
     * to the intersection of the two drawing areas. Recursively, you can use as many
     * drawing_areas as you wish for drawing operations.
