     * This class manages %character schedules. Each %character has a
     * manager script that defines what it does all day long. It has to
     * provide a "run" method that will be executed whenever it is time
     * to choose a different occupation.
     * 
     * The character's actual activity is controlled by the actual 
     * %schedule scripts that get selected by the manager script, depending 
     * on various factors. These schedules must be event driven and will
     * normally not be called from the engine, except on the following
     * occasions:
     *
     * - When starting a new schedule, it's "start" method is called.
     * - When setting a character inactive, the "pause" method is called.
     * - When resuming character activity, the "resume" method is called.
     * - When changing to a new schedule, its "stop" method is called.
     *
     * There are also calls to the constructor (__init__) and destructor
     * (__del__) at the start respectively end of the schedules lifetime.
     *
     * It is possible to bypass the manager schedule and select a new
     * schedule by queuing it prior to calling set_running(false).
